# LeetCode Practice Workspace

This repository is a personal workspace where I solve LeetCode problems before submitting them on the official LeetCode platform. Each problem is organized in its own folder, containing my C language solutions.

## Structure
- Each problem is organized in its own folder (named after the problem).
- Inside each problem folder, there is a `C/` subfolder containing the C language solution file.
- Solution files are named after the problem (e.g., `long_common_prefix.c`).
## Problems Solved
- **Longest Common Prefix** (`Longest_Common_Prefix/C/long_common_prefix.c`)
- **Palindrome** (`Palindrome/C/palindrome.c`)
- **Roman to Integer** (`Roman-to-Integer/C/roman-to-integer.c`)
- **Two Sum** (`Two_Sum/C/two_Sum.c`)
- **Valid Parentheses** (`Valid_Parentheses/C/valid_parentheses.c`)
- **Merge Two Sorted Lists** (`Merge_Two_Sort_Lists/C/mergw_sort_lists.c`)

## Currently Working On
- **Merge Two Sorted Lists** (`Merge_Two_Sort_Lists/C/mergw_sort_lists.c`)

## Usage
Feel free to browse the problem folders and review the solutions in their respective `C/` subfolders. This repo is mainly for personal practice and reference.
