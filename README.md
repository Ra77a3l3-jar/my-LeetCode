# LeetCode Practice Workspace

This repository is a personal workspace where I solve LeetCode problems before submitting them on the official LeetCode platform. Each problem is organized in its own folder, containing my C language solutions.

## Structure
- Each folder corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem.
- Solutions are written in C and named after the problem.

## Problems Solved
- **Longest Common Prefix** (`long_common_prefix.c`)
- **Palindrome** (`palindrome.c`)
- **Roman to Integer** (`roman-to-integer.c`)
- **Two Sum** (`two_Sum.c`)
- **Merge Two Sorted Lists** (`mergw_sort_lists.c`)

## Currently Working On
- **Merge Two Sorted Lists** (`mergw_sort_lists.c`)

## Usage
Feel free to browse the folders and review the solutions. This repo is mainly for personal practice and reference.
