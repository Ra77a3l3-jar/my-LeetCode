# LeetCode Practice Workspace

This repository is a personal workspace where I solve LeetCode problems before submitting them on the official LeetCode platform. Each problem is organized in its own folder, containing my solutions in C and occasionally Python.

## Structure
- Each problem is organized in its own folder (named after the problem, using underscores for spaces).
- Inside each problem folder, there is a `C/` subfolder containing the C language solution file.
- Some problems also have a `Python/` subfolder containing Python solutions.
- Solution files are named after the problem, using lowercase and underscores (e.g., `long_common_prefix.c`, `two_sum.py`).

## Problems Solved
- **Longest Common Prefix** (`Longest_Common_Prefix/C/long_common_prefix.c`)
- **Palindrome** (`Palindrome/C/palindrome.c`, `Palindrome/Python/palindrome.py`)
- **Roman to Integer** (`Roman_to_Integer/C/roman_to_integer.c`)
- **Two Sum** (`Two_Sum/C/two_sum.c`, `Two_Sum/Python/two_sum.py`)
- **Valid Parentheses** (`Valid_Parentheses/C/valid_parentheses.c`)
- **Merge Two Sorted Lists** (`Merge_Two_Sort_Lists/C/merge_sort_lists.c`)
- **Remove Duplicated from Sorted List** (`Remove_Duplicated_from_Sorted_List/C/remove_duplicates_sort_list.c`)
- **Remove Element** (`Remove_Element/C/remove_element.c`)

## Currently Working On
- (No active problem. Update this section when starting a new one.)

## Usage
Feel free to browse the problem folders and review the solutions in their respective `C/` and `Python/` subfolders. This repo is mainly for personal practice and reference.
